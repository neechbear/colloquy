Usage: .set width <terminal width | auto>

Allows you to select the width of the terminal you are using.
Auto attempts to determine the screen size automagically, but will
only work on 'colour' terminals.  Also, if you set the width to 0,
the talker will not wrap lines of text to you.  (Although tabular
information will be formatted to the default 79 characters.)
