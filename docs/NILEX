Things Colloquy does that NILEX/EH doesn't
------------------------------------------

* Lists
  - Anonymous lists
  - Non-permanent list quotas
  - Different colouring for list name on list talk
  - List expiry after non-use
  - Automatically unpauses (unignores) a list when you talk to it
  - Lists have owners who can't leave, etc.
  - Read-only lists (only list masters may speak.)
  - List of lists is sorted!
  - Tracks list creation and last use times
  - Displays who is idle and who is ignoring lists in .list info

* Users
  - Tracks group talk bytes as a better measurement of usage than talk time.
  - Tracks users' last disconnect message/reason
  - Restriction "Bot" along with "Gagged" rather than an ugly bot "privilege"
  - Passwords are stored as dictionary attack-proof MD5 hashes.
  - Users can be authenticated and created via an external process, for
    integration into NIS, or a WinNT Domain Controller.
  - Users can hide fields from .info from either guest users, or non-Masters

* Privs
  - .warn taken out of K, and put into W.
  - .helpuser to show a user a help page as H.
  - .lua for debugging purposes as L.
  - Z for immunity to .kick, .name, etc.

* User Interface
  - TinyFugue compatible prompts that show context (.querying, etc.)
  - Commands can be contracted, just like usernames (so .ex can be used instead
    of .examine, as .ex is unambiguous.)
  - Whispering to multiple people, including exclusions.  Such as:
    >bob,kinni Hello! and >@public,-foo Foo smells.
  - Whispering "reply" to last person/multitell that whispered to you via
    >| (pipe)
  - Bots aren't shown at all in .groups, .who, etc.  (seen via .bots)
  - Adjustable terminal width via .set width, including an "auto" mode to
    automatically detect the width from compatiable terminals, as well as
    a "no wrap" mode for client-side wrapping.

* New commands
  - .Bots - lists connected bots, and their purpose.
  - .Censor/.UnCensor - tries to stop people swearing by starring out rude words
  - .HelpUser - shows a help page to another user
  - .Idle - marks a user as idle (very similar to TOTH's)
  - .Idlers - lists idle users, their reason, and how long they've been idling.
  - .LWho - Lists who is connected to the talker, and is also a member of a
    specific list
  - .LastOn - shows when a user was last seen, either for a single user or
    for all members of a list.
  - .Lua - Executes code in the talker's VM for debugging
  - .Request - Leaves a request for features etc for the masters
  - .Bot/.Unbot - flags a user as a bot

* .Ignore
  - Can silently ignore somebody, so they don't get told.

* .Evict
  - You can evict somebody from Public into Limbo.

* .Mark .-
  - Shows the current time at the end of the dashes.

* .NameSelf
  - Allows a user to change the capitalisation of their name without telling
    everybody else.

* .Stats
  - Shows all sorts of other information, including uptime, cache information,
    and more in-depth resource usage information.

* .Shout
  - Allows emoted shouts via !; etc.

There is of course likely to be all sorts of other things I've forgotten about
but already take for granted. :)

Things NILEX/EH does that Colloquy doesn't
------------------------------------------

* Commands
  - .Cookie - It returns a random number selected when you connected.  No, I
    can't work out its use either.

* Misc
  - Run Egham Hills. :)

There are likely to be others.  I can't be bothered to check too deep, though.
